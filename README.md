This is another front-end challenge done by me, widss

At first i was struggling with the logic needed to form a bar chart. But, after looking through other projects, I got inspiration on how to achieve it. By manipulating the shape of a div, and using the money value to calculate the height.

There are still some refactoring needed, especially on the css side. But overall, working on this project was a lot of fun.# Expense-Chart-by-Frontend-Mentor
